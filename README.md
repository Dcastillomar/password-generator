Random Password Generator

Description 

The motivation for this project is to allow users to create a strong password and have choice about the characters in the password.

I built this project to solve a need for people who want a stronger randomized security password.

This project shows off my skills working with JavaScript.

I learned a lot about JavaScript. Also other components like variables, arrays, loops and functions.
